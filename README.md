# Week 06: Midterm

Congratulations! You're halfway through the course!


## Midterm: About Me Web Page  

For the midterm, translate your About Me mockup into a web page.  
* Remember to use semantic markup. Check to make sure you have no HTML and CSS validation errors.  
* You must use a multi-column layout. Your page should demonstrate an understanding of web typography.  
* The target screen is the desktop at 960px wide. Make sure that your page doesn't scroll horizontally at 960px. (Use the [PSD template from week02](https://github.com/ICPDesignCode/week02) to help you position and visualize your page elements.)
* Make sure your web page looks like your Photoshop mockup.
* Use GitHub to host your About Me page. Also include your PSD mockup in the same GitHub repo for reference.  
* Once your page is live, update the index.html file on the _gh-pages_ branch of this (midterm) repository and submit a pull request no later than noon on Monday, Nov. 2.
  * Under the Students section, for _your_ card, add the link to your live About Me page where indicated so that the Learn More link points to your About Me page.
  * Provide a 300 x 250 image that more suitably represents you or your About Me page to replace the placeholder image on your student card. Update the image path accordingly.
* Your web page must be live no later than noon on Monday, Nov. 2.  
* Tips: You may want to tweak your mockup so you don't have crazy measurements like 99.08931px. Standardize your color palette so you don't have several different values of the same color that look visually very similar.  


## Midterm Presentation  

On the day of the midterms (Nov 2), you have 15 minutes to present your About Me page and another 5 minutes to respond to questions from the class.  
  * What do you want people to know about you? How do you want to be perceived?
  * How does the design reflect your mission as an artist or as a professional?
  * Were there any challenges? What did you do to try to overcome them?
  * Highlight a couple of technical features that you're proud of.
